This is a low level utility to read from a number of file descriptors that are
assumed to produce a valid pcap dump stream and then write all packets from
those streams to an aggregate dump stream on stdout.

   Usage: merge-pcap-streams <fd1> [fd2] [fdn...]

One way to use this tool is to wrap it in a program that forks a bunch of
tcpdump child processes and then exec()s this program, passing in the
file descriptor for the read pipe for each child process on the command line.
In this way it's possible to produce a tool that, for example, takes a
filter and a set of hosts and remotely executes tcpdump on those hosts
via SSH, using merge-pcap-streams to aggregate the resulting data.

Here's a dumb example using just a single fd, which kinda defeats the point
but serves to show how you might invoke tcpdump:

    tcpdump -i eth0 -U -q -w - | merge-pcap-streams 0 | tcpdump -r -
